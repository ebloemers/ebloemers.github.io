<h2>A little bit about me...</h2>
<p/> I was born and raised in Wausau, Wisconsin. If you're not familiar with where that is, I'll let you know that it's right in the middle of the state! I was raised by my two parents, Bryan and Kerry, and grew up along side my brothers, Ethan and Evan. Our newest edition, our dog Lucy, is one of the best parts of visiting home! I have always been a home body and valuing family will always be my core.</p>

<h2> Where I am now...</h2>

<p> For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to be a student at The University of Wisconsin-Madison. I have always valued my eduation and have been a self-motivated student. I was determined in high school to have a strong applicaiton for the university by being involved in the dance team, softball, musicals, and various club opportunites - and Guess What?</p>
<h2> The hard work paid off!</h2>
<p>I am currently a sophomore (Class of 2023) at The University of Wisconsin-Madison. I plan to study Marketing through the Business School and receive certificates in Digital Studies and Textiles and Design. If we are talking about big dreams, I would LOVE to be a buyer for a wedding dress boutique, but I am eager to explore and discover new passions in relation to my career goals.

UW-Madison prides itself on providing opportunities for its students to continue hobbies and develop new passions. When I find the time to take a break from school, I have taken advantage of the clubs (choosing from hundreds of options was a little tricky) that the university offers including the Student Retail Association, EmBark, & Dance Elite. </p>
