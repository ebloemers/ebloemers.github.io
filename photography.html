<p> Last semester, I was enrolled in the course Communication Arts 155. This course is designed to introduce students to various digital media platforms including photography, podcast, webistes, and video production.</p>
<p>For the photography assignment, we were assigned to capture ten photos following specific photography techniques.
I used this project to explore my aesthetic and challenged my creative limits while being at home due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The three photos below are some of my personal favorites.
