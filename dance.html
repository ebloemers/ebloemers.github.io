  <p>I have been a competitve dancer my entire life and the UW-Dance Elite team was the perfect fit for me! The team is intended for those who want to hold on to their passion for dance through college. As a team, we practice twice a week, compete at local competitions, perform at university sporting events, and represent the Badgers at community events! I am so grateful for the opportunites, friendships, and memories that this team has brought me!
